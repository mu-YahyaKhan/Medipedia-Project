            Pulmonary disease refers to any condition that affects the lungs or respiratory system, causing breathing difficulties and reduced lung function. It includes a wide range of disorders, from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to more serious diseases like lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Common types of pulmonary diseases include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Asthma:</strong> A chronic condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing.</li>
              <li><strong>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):</strong> A group of progressive lung diseases, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, that obstruct airflow and cause breathing problems.</li>
              <li><strong>Pulmonary Fibrosis:</strong> A condition where lung tissue becomes scarred, leading to reduced lung capacity and difficulty breathing.</li>
              <li><strong>Lung Cancer:</strong> A form of cancer that originates in the lungs and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>How common are Pulmonary Diseases?</h2>
          <p>
            Pulmonary diseases are highly prevalent and affect millions of people worldwide:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Approximately 251 million people worldwide suffer from chronic respiratory diseases.</li>
            <li>Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths globally, responsible for around 1.8 million deaths annually.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
          <p>Common signs and symptoms of pulmonary disease include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shortness of breath, especially during physical activity</li>
            <li>Chronic cough, which may produce mucus or phlegm</li>
            <li>Wheezing or a whistling sound when breathing</li>
            <li>Chest tightness</li>
            <li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>
            <li>Fatigue or feeling easily exhausted</li>

          <h2>Causes of Pulmonary Diseases</h2>
          <p>Pulmonary diseases can have various causes, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> The leading cause of COPD and lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals that damage the lungs.</li>
            <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Exposure to pollutants, such as chemicals, dust, and fumes, can contribute to respiratory problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> A family history of lung disease can increase the risk of developing pulmonary conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Infections:</strong> Respiratory infections like pneumonia and tuberculosis can cause long-term lung damage if left untreated.</li>
            <li><strong>Occupational Exposure:</strong> Jobs that involve exposure to hazardous substances (e.g., asbestos) can increase the risk of lung disease.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
          <p>Healthcare providers use several diagnostic tools to detect pulmonary diseases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chest X-ray:</strong> Helps identify lung abnormalities like tumors, pneumonia, or fibrosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Spirometry:</strong> Measures lung function and airflow to diagnose conditions like asthma and COPD.</li>
            <li><strong>CT Scan:</strong> A more detailed imaging test that provides high-resolution pictures of the lungs.</li>
            <li><strong>Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Test:</strong> Measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood to assess lung function.</li>
            <li><strong>Bronchoscopy:</strong> A procedure in which a flexible tube is inserted into the airways to view the lungs and take biopsies if needed.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

          <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
          <p>While pulmonary diseases are often chronic, many can be managed with the right treatment:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Bronchodilators, steroids, and other medications help relieve symptoms and manage airflow.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Quitting smoking, avoiding pollutants, and maintaining a healthy weight are essential for managing pulmonary disease.</li>
            <li><strong>Oxygen Therapy:</strong> People with severe lung diseases may need supplemental oxygen to help with breathing.</li>
            <li><strong>Lung Rehabilitation:</strong> A program that includes exercise, education, and support to help individuals manage their pulmonary conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> In some cases, surgical options like lung transplants or removal of tumors may be necessary.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Prevention</h2>
          <p>Preventing pulmonary diseases involves adopting a healthy lifestyle and reducing exposure to harmful substances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid smoking or quit if you are a smoker.</li>
            <li>Reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and air pollutants.</li>
            <li>Exercise regularly to maintain healthy lungs and improve cardiovascular health.</li>
            <li>Get vaccinated to prevent respiratory infections like flu and pneumonia.</li>
            <li>Wear protective gear if working in environments with airborne hazards.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Outlook/Prognosis</h2>
          <p>
            The prognosis for pulmonary diseases depends on the type, severity, and timely management of the condition. Early diagnosis, treatment adherence, and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent complications.
