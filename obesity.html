            Obesity is a complex health condition characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the body. It is often defined by having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. Obesity can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several factors that contribute to obesity:

              <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Living in an environment that encourages unhealthy eating habits and a sedentary lifestyle.</li>

          <h2>Causes of Obesity</h2>
          <p>Obesity is caused by a combination of factors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Caloric Imbalance:</strong> Consuming more calories than the body needs, leading to fat storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Inactivity:</strong> A sedentary lifestyle leads to fewer calories burned and higher fat accumulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Consuming high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages, especially sugary drinks and processed foods.</li>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Genetic factors can affect how fat is stored and how the body uses energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Social and Economic Factors:</strong> Low socioeconomic status can limit access to healthy food options and exercise opportunities.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
          <p>Obesity is typically diagnosed through physical examination and measurements, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Body Mass Index (BMI):</strong> A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.</li>
            <li><strong>Waist Circumference:</strong> Measuring waist size can provide insights into fat distribution, which is important for determining risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Waist-to-Hip Ratio:</strong> The ratio of the circumference of the waist to the hips is another indicator of obesity-related risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Body Fat Percentage:</strong> A more detailed measure of fat mass in the body compared to lean mass.</li>
          </ul>
